> **Abstract:** *We present a novel Animation CelebHeads dataset (AnimeCeleb) to address an animation head reenactment. Different from previous animation head datasets, we utilize a 3D animation models as the controllable image samplers, which can provide a large amount of head images with their corresponding detailed pose annotations. To facilitate a data creation process, we build a semi-automatic pipeline leveraging an open 3D computer graphics software with a developed annotation system. After training with the AnimeCeleb, recent head reenactment models produce high-quality animation head reenactment results, which are not achievable with existing datasets. Furthermore, motivated by metaverse application, we propose a novel pose mapping method and architecture to tackle   a cross-domain head reenactment task. During inference, a user can easily transfer one's motion to an arbitrary animation head. Experiments demonstrate an usefulness of the AnimeCeleb to train animation head reenactment models, and the superiority of our cross-domain head reenactment model compared to state-of-the-art methods.*

## Notice

The official datasets and codes for dataset creation pipeline and proposed model will be updated soon. Please stay tuned.
